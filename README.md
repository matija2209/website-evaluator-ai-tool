# Website Sophistication Analyzer

## üéâ **PROJECT COMPLETE** - All 4 Phases Delivered + Design Age Estimation!

A comprehensive tool for analyzing company websites to evaluate their digital sophistication and identify improvement opportunities.

**‚úÖ PRODUCTION READY**: Complete end-to-end pipeline from directory listings to AI-powered website analysis with design age estimation

## Overview

This project transforms directory listings (from sources like bizi.si, zlatestrani.si) into actual company websites, captures screenshots, and uses AI analysis to assess website sophistication across multiple criteria including design age estimation.

## Features

- **Website Discovery**: Finds actual company websites from directory listings using Google Custom Search API
- **Screenshot Capture**: Takes sectioned screenshots (desktop & mobile) for comprehensive analysis
- **AI Analysis**: Uses Gemini 2.0 Flash for sophisticated website evaluation
- **üé® Design Age Estimation**: Determines website design era from Early 2000s to Modern 2020s
- **Progress Tracking**: Resume-capable processing with CSV-based progress tracking
- **Batch Processing**: Handles large datasets with rate limiting and error handling

## Installation

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Dependencies

- `playwright` - For screenshot capture (browser automation)
- `sharp` - For image compression and processing
- `@google/generative-ai` - Gemini AI integration
- `@googleapis/customsearch` - Google Custom Search API
- `csv-parser` & `csv-writer` - CSV processing
- `axios` - HTTP requests
- `cheerio` - HTML parsing
- `fs-extra` - File system utilities
- `dayjs` - Date handling

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file with your API keys:

```env
GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY=your_GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY_here
```

## Usage

### Complete Pipeline (All Phases)

```bash
# Phase 1 & 2: Website Discovery
npm run start /path/to/companies.csv

# Phase 3: Screenshot Capture
npm run screenshot [RUN_ID] [concurrency]
npm run screenshot 20250629_110643 1

# Phase 4: AI Analysis
npm run analyze [RUN_ID] [force]
npm run analyze 20250629_110643
npm run analyze 20250629_110643 force  # Force reanalysis
```

### Individual Phase Commands

```bash
# Testing commands
npm run test                    # Infrastructure tests
npm run test:phase2            # Website discovery tests  
npm run test:ai-analysis       # AI analysis tests

# Development
npm run dev                    # Watch mode for development
npm run build                  # TypeScript compilation
npm run clean                  # Clean build artifacts
```

### Input CSV Format

The input CSV should contain company data with these headers:

```
Filter Group,Title,URL,Street Address,City,Business ID,Tax Number,Activity Description,Employee Count,Page
```

**Note**: Input URLs are directory listings, not actual company websites. The tool will discover the actual websites.

## Processing Pipeline

The tool follows a sequential 4-phase approach:

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Environment setup and data preparation
- Creates run-specific directories with timestamp-based RUN_ID

### Phase 2: Website Discovery üî• **CRITICAL PHASE**
- Uses Google Custom Search API to find actual company websites
- AI-enhanced intelligent website selection (vs simple "first result")
- Applies domain exclusion filters (directories, social media)
- Companies without discovered websites are excluded from further processing

### Phase 3: Screenshot Capture
- Captures sectioned screenshots for both desktop and mobile views
- Uses Playwright for reliable browser automation
- Organizes screenshots by domain in structured folders
- Only processes companies with successfully discovered websites

### Phase 4: AI Analysis ‚ú® **ENHANCED WITH DESIGN AGE ESTIMATION**
- Uses Gemini 2.0 Flash for sophisticated website evaluation
- Mobile-first scoring (70% mobile + 30% desktop weighting)
- 4-criteria analysis: Visual Design, Technical, Content, UX
- **üé® Design Age Estimation**: Analyzes design patterns to determine era:
  - **EARLY_2000S**: Table layouts, basic colors
  - **MID_2000S**: Flash elements, limited CSS
  - **LATE_2000S**: CSS frameworks, gradients
  - **EARLY_2010S**: jQuery effects, basic responsive
  - **MID_2010S**: Bootstrap era, flat design
  - **LATE_2010S**: Card layouts, material design
  - **EARLY_2020S**: Modern frameworks, CSS Grid
  - **MODERN_2020S**: Component-based, advanced interactions
- Context-aware recommendations based on business activity
- Only processes companies with successful screenshots

## Output

The main output is in `runs/[RUN_ID]/website-discovery-progress.csv` with all phase results:

**Core Company Data:**
```
Company_Name, Cleaned_Name, City, Original_URL, Discovered_Website
```

**Phase 2 - Website Discovery:**
```
Search_Status, SERP_Position, AI_Confidence, AI_Reasoning, Tokens_Used
```

**Phase 3 - Screenshot Capture:**
```
Screenshot_Status, Desktop_Sections, Mobile_Sections, Load_Time_MS, Screenshot_Timestamp
```

**Phase 4 - AI Analysis (ENHANCED):**
```
Analysis_Status, Mobile_Score, Desktop_Score, Combined_Score, 
Sophistication_Level, Opportunity_Level, Design_Era, Design_Reasoning,
Mobile_Issues, Desktop_Issues, Quick_Wins, Major_Upgrades, 
Analysis_Confidence, Analysis_Reasoning, Analysis_Tokens_Used, Analysis_Timestamp
```

## Configuration

Key settings in `config.ts`:

- **Batch Size**: 15 companies for rate-limited phases
- **Rate Limiting**: 2000ms delays between AI analysis calls
- **Retry Logic**: Up to 3 attempts per phase
- **Google Custom Search**: 10 results per query with 100ms delays
- **üé® AI Analysis**: Enhanced prompts with design era indicators, 1500 token limit

## Error Handling

- **No website found**: Marked as `NO_WEBSITE_FOUND`, excluded from further processing
- **Screenshot failed**: Marked as `SCREENSHOT_FAILED`, excluded from AI analysis
- **Analysis failed**: Marked as `ANALYSIS_FAILED`, included in output with error status

## Resume Capability

Each phase tracks progress in CSV files, allowing the tool to resume from the last successful point if interrupted.

## Development Approach

**Sequential Development**: Each phase must be perfected individually before moving to the next:

1. **Phase 1**: Foundation (Days 1-2)
2. **Phase 2**: Website Discovery (Days 3-5) ‚Üê **CORE PHASE**
3. **Phase 3**: Screenshot Capture (Days 6-8)
4. **Phase 4**: AI Analysis (Days 9-11)
5. **Phase 5**: Integration & Testing (Days 12-15)

## Success Criteria

- **Phase 2**: 60-80% website discovery success rate
- **Phase 3**: 90%+ screenshot success rate for reachable websites
- **Phase 4**: Consistent scoring and token usage within budget
- **Full Pipeline**: Process complete dataset without crashes

## Performance Results

**Live Testing (2 companies):**
- **Phase 2**: 100% website discovery success
- **Phase 3**: 100% screenshot capture success (22 sections)
- **Phase 4**: 100% AI analysis success (~5,500 tokens per website)

**Estimated Production (717 companies):**
- **Total Time**: 6-10 hours for complete pipeline
- **Success Rate**: 70-90% website discovery (~500-650 companies)
- **API Costs**: 
  - Gemini 2.0 Flash: ~$45-90 (increased for design age analysis)
  - Google Custom Search: ~$100-200
  - **Total**: ~$145-290
